version 1.4
-----------

- put terminated calls with BYE->OK immediately into CDR database and not wait 5 minutes for packet inactivity
- Comment out ASSERT in jitterbuffer which prevents crashes in cases, where pcap delivers reordered packets.
- continue on timeout when reading live packets, it prevents crashes dereferencing packet structure which can points to uninitialized value or to invalid memory
- For very high packet loss there were problem with bursts calculation and MOS were not reflecting such high packet loss. There were calls with mos 4.5 and 55% packet loss. Now it is fixed.
- For calls with more than two RTP streams (typically one is early media and after connect another two RTP streams represent each side which changes ssrc) voipmonitor saves statistics for two RTP streams only. Two streams are chosen based on received packets. But for very high losses it was choosen not ones with the highest received packets. I've fixed this to sort it based on received packet + packet loss to avoid this.


version 1.3
-----------
- hash search function for classifying RTP packets to its Call structure. This will speedup voipmonitor for high call volumes. 
- fix 100% CPU whan -k was given
- log big timestamp jump only if verbose is > 4
- log MySQL query error to syslog
- handle MySQL error "2006 - MySQL server has gone away" as reconnecting to database
- fix crashes when dereferencing NULL packet. Sometimes it happens that pcap_next returns NULL pointer. Thanks Carlos Talbot!
- save caller ID with NAME field from SIP INVITE and store it to cdr.callername MySQL column (thanks Carlos Talbot)

UPGRADE: cat cdrtable.sql.1.2.1-1.3 | mysql voipmonitor


version 1.2.1
-------------
- fix random crashing (dereferencing NULL pointer) in jitterbuffer simulator. 

version 1.2
-----------

- fix bug: On some systems (gentoo libpcap-1.0) when live capturing, 
  voipmonitor ends after few seconds. It was caused by pcap_next function 
  which returns NULL frame. Instead of pcap_next, use
  pcap_next_ex which returns status code. 
- make mysql table optional with `cdr` as default
- support for graph compress via gzstream library (included)
- new long options (--mysql-user, etc.)
- add support for pid file to make start scripts happy (thanks Vladislav Krakhalev)
