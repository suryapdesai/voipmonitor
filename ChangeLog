version 1.2
-----------

- fix bug: On some systems (gentoo libpcap-1.0) when live capturing, 
  voipmonitor ends after few seconds. It was caused by pcap_next function 
  which returns NULL frame. Instead of pcap_next, use
  pcap_next_ex which returns status code. 
- make mysql table optional with `cdr` as default
- support for graph compress via gzstream library (included)
- new long options (--mysql-user, etc.)
- add support for pid file to make start scripts happy (thanks Vladislav Krakhalev)
