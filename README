What is VoIPmonitor
-------------------

VoIPmonitor is open source live network packet sniffer which analyze SIP 
and RTP protocol. It can run as daemon or analyzes already captured pcap 
files. For each detected VoIP call voipmonitor calculates statistics about 
loss, burstiness, latency and predicts MOS (Meaning Opinion Score) according 
to ITU-T G.107 E-model. These statistics are saved to MySQL database and each 
call is saved as pcap dump. Web PHP application (it is not part of open 
source sniffer) filters data from database and graphs latency and loss 
distribution. Voipmonitor also detects improperly terminated calls when 
BYE or OK was not seen. To accuratly transform latency to loss packets, 
voipmonitor simulates fixed and adaptive jitterbuffer.

Key features
------------

- Fast C++ SIP/RTP packet analyzer
- Predicts MOS-LQE score according to ITU-T G.107 E-model
- Detailed delay/loss statistics stored to MySQL
- Each call is saved as standalone pcap file

What is required
----------------

- C and C++ compiler (gcc,g++)
- libpcap-dev package >= 0.8 (almost in every linux distribution)
- MySQL++ library from http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/
- zlib ibrary 


Compile
-------

This howto is for Debian Lenny and Etch (for Debian sarge, change libmysqlclient15-dev to libmysqlclient14-dev)

apt-get install libpcap-dev libmysqlclient15-dev zlib1g-dev
wget http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/releases/mysql++-3.0.9.tar.gz
tar xzf mysql++-3.0.9.tar.gz
cd mysql++-3.0.9
./configure
make install
ldconfig
cd ../voipmonitor
make
make install

MySQL
