# listening interface. Can be 'any' which will listen on all interfaces - NOTE that "any" will not put intefaces into promiscuous mode and you have to do it with "ifconfig eth0 promisc"
# check if you are not using -i ethX argument in command line as it has more priority 
# than this configuration file
interface = eth0

# in case the SIP(media) server is behind public IP (1.1.1.1) NATed to private IP (10.0.0.3) to sniff all traffic correctly you can 
# specify alias for this case. You can specify more netaliases duplicating rows. 
# in most cases this is not neccessary because voipmonitor is able to track both RTP streams based on the other side IP. But 
# if the stream is incoming from another IP then SIP source signalization and also from another IP than the SIP device which is 
# also behind NAT its impossible to track the correct IP. Please note that this is for case where the SIP server is behind NAT
# and also the client is behind NAT. If your SIP server has public IP do not bother with this.

# Set ring buffer in MB (feature of newer >= 2.6.31 kernels). If you see voipmonitor 
# dropping packets in syslog upgrade to newer kernel and increase --ring-buffer to 
# higher MB. It is buffer between pcap library and voipmonitor. The most reason why 
# voipmonitor drops packets is waiting for I/O operations (switching to ext4 from 
# ext3 also helps. Defaults to 10 MB. WARNING: if you set it to much (over 2000) it 
# will silently default to some low value - libpcap does not warns so the only way is 
# to check how much memory voipmonitor uses right after start.

# jitter buffer simulator variants. By default voipmonitor uses three types of jitterbuffer simulator to compute MOS score. 
# First variant is saved into cdr.[ab]_f1 and represents MOS score for devices which has only fixed 50ms jitterbuffer. 
# Second variant is same as first but for fixed 200ms and is saved to cdr.[ab]_f2
# Third varinat is adaptive jitterbuffer simulator up to 500ms
# Jitterbuffer simulator is the most CPU intensive task which is voipmonitor doing. If you are hitting CPU 100% turn
# off some of the jitterbuffer simulator. I'm recomending to use only fixed 200ms if you need to save some CPU cycles.

# this is important option if voipmonitor is sniffing on SIP proxy and see both RTP leg of CALL.
# in that case use this option. It will analyze RTP only for the first LEG and not each 4 RTP
# streams which will confuse voipmonitor. Drawback of this switch is that voipmonitor will analyze
# SDP only for SIP packets which have the same IP and port of the first INVITE source IP
# and port. It means it will not work in case where phone sends INVITE from a.b.c.d:1024 and
# SIP proxy replies to a.b.c.d:5060. If you have better idea how to solve this problem better

# save RTP payload to audio file. Choose 'wav' for WAV PCM or 'ogg' for OGG 25kbps format.
