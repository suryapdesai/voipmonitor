[general]

# in case of running more voipmonitor instances on the same or another servers configured to save to one database and the same cdr table
# it is possible to differentiate CDR by id_sensor column. If you set id_sensor >= 0 the number will be saved in cdr.id_sensor column.
#id_sensor = 1

# voipmonitor is able to sniff directly on network interface or it can read files. 

# listening interface. Can be 'any' which will listen on all interfaces - NOTE that "any" will not put intefaces into promiscuous mode and you have to do it with "ifconfig eth0 promisc"
# check if you are not using -i ethX argument in command line as it has more priority 
# than this configuration file
interface = eth0

# scan pcap files folder and read file by file. This is in conjuction with running tcpdump which creates pcap file each 
# 5 seconds (-G 5) storing pcap files named by UNIX_TIMESTAMP to /dev/shm/voipmonitor folder (do not forget create it) 
# using 1GB ring buffer to avoid losing packets (-B500000 - you can lower it but not higher) filtering udp packets (udp 
# parameter whcih you can change to your needs). voipmonitor then reads created files (and delete it after processing. 
# This approach can be used for testing throughput or for very high voip traffic (>500Mbit). If the sniffer is able to 
# process pcap files in realtime - there will be in /dev/shm/voipmonitor folder only one or two pcap files. If the sniffer 
# is not able to process in realtime (blocking by I/O or by CPU) number of pcap files will grow faster then the sniffer
# is able process. 
#
# WARNING: libpcap < 1.1 contains memory leak when pcap filter is set - do not set filter in this config or upgrade libpcap to the latest (debian 6 libpcap contains the leak)

# mirror SIP packets to specified IP address. IP is mirrored by ip in ip protocol. This is usefull in case
# the primary voipmonitor machine see all SIP packets but only part of RTP packets and the second voipmonitor server
# see only RTP packets -> in this case you can mirror SIP packets to second voipmonitor server IP. voipmonitor already
# supports ip in ip so no configuration is needed to accept ip in ip mirrored packets. (this mirroring supports for example
# acme packet SBC).
# mirroring can be also usefull for another general purpose - it is also parsed by wireshark/tshark etc. 
# if you enable mirrorip you have to set mirroripsrc and mirroripdst 
# if voipmonitor is run with "-r file" (not matter if it is file or /dev/stdin etc) this option is forced to off

# in case the SIP(media) server is behind public IP (1.1.1.1) NATed to private IP (10.0.0.3) to sniff all traffic correctly you can

# in most cases this is not necessary because voipmonitor is able to track both RTP streams based on the other side IP. But 
# if the stream is incoming from another IP then SIP source signalization and also from another IP than the SIP device which is 
# also behind NAT its impossible to track the correct IP. Please note that this is for case where the SIP server is behind NAT

# and port. It means it will not work in case where phone sends INVITE from a.b.c.d:1024 and
